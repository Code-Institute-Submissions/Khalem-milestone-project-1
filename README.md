# Milestone Project 1
My project is a static website for rock band "Deep Purple". I had a great time building what is essentially my first website. My biggest priority was
ensuring that the website was fully responsive. 

I decided to go for one scrollable page rather than having multiple pages. I went with a scrollable page because of the lack of content on the website.

## UX
For my project, I was tasked with creating a website for a rock band from the 60's. The band's primary target are their fans and potential fans,
who can listen to their music and be notified when anything new is released. I decided to go with a clean design, so information is easily taken in.
#### User Stories: 
* ***As a user I can:*** book a gig.

* ***As a user I can:*** listen to the bands music.

* ***As a user I can:*** sign up for newsletter.

* ***As a user I can:*** click on a social media link.

I have included my wireframe in the folder "wireframe". I have left both pdf and jpg versions of it. I have also left the original gravit design file
if you'd like to dig a little deeper.

## Features
#### Existing Features:
* ***Navigation:*** Allows userto navigate website with ease.
* ***Book now button:*** Allows user to book a gig as soon as they load the website by filling a form.
* ***Photos:*** Gives new users an idea of what the band looks like.
* ***Video:*** Gives potential clients an idea of what a live performance would look like.
* ***Music:*** New users could possibly become fans by being able to listen to music.
* ***Newsletter*** sign up: Allows fans to stay up to date with new music.
* ***Social media links:*** Creates a social media presence for the band.

#### Features Left to Implement:
There is one feature which I would have like to have added in if I had though of it sooner. I would've liked to have added in an award page where
the band could showcase their accomplishments.

## Technologies Used
[Boostrap](https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)

[FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Testing
As mentioned before, making the website responsive as possible was a great concern for me. So I did extensive testing to make sure the website is
functional on all devices and browsers. I was pleased with the results. However my mentor pointed out to me that parts of the website were misaligned
on larger screens. I then fixed the issues and I am happy with the results!

All user stories work as intended (apart from actually submitting form but we haven't covered that yet). If a user does not fill out any form input
they will recieve an error.

## Deployment
I decided to deploy the website on GitHub Pages. In order to deploy it I went into my repository settings and set the GitHub Pages source to master branch.
